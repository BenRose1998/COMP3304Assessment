## Image Manipulation Library
A low-level image manipulation tool that allows for loading, editting and saving of images.

The goal of this software is to implement SOLID design principles to strengthen cohesion and loosen coupling, facilitated by design patterns.

Design Patterns include:
- Dependency Injection
- Event Delegate
- Command
- Generic Factory
- Service Locator

Split into 3 class libraries: View, Controller and Model.

Third party library used: [ImageProcessor](https://imageprocessor.org/)
